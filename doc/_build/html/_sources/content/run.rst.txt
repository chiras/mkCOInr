Run mkCOInr
===========================================

The scripts were written and tested on Linux. MacOS users will probably be able to run them. I suggest `WSL <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>`_  for Windows users.

**To run any of the scripts, open a terminal in the 'scripts' folder and type**

.. code-block:: bash

	cd ~/mkCOInr/scripts
	perl name_of_the_script.pl -argument_name argument_value


This list of arguments and options can be obtained by typing

.. code-block:: bash

	perl name_of_the_script.pl -help
