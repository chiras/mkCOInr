mkCOInr is a series of Perl scripts that aims to create **COInr, a comprehensive COI database form NCBI-nucleotide and BOLD** and customize it. 

COInr is freely available and can be downloaded from `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6555985>`_

The database can be used for similarity-based taxonomic assignations of metabarcoding data with any COI marker (primer pairs) of any geographical regions or target group.

Alternatively, the **database can be used as a starting point to create smaller, more specific custom databases**. Sequences can be selected for :

    - A particular gene region (amplicon of a given primer pair)
    - List of taxa (sequences of a taxon list can be eiter selected or eliminated)
    - User-defined minimal taxonomic resolution

The database can be formatted to the following formats

    - BLAST
    - RDP classifier
    - QIIME
    - FULL TSV
